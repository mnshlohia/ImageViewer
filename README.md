# ImageViewer

This is a Image Loading and viewer app using Reddit Api to load images and view them.

It uses memory cache and disk cache to load images if images are already loaded earlier.

Used LruCache for Memory caching and Jake Whalton's Disk Cache for Disk Cache.

Also, apart from that have used MVVM, Dagger2, Retrofit2, Coroutines , Jetpack Paging and Jetpack Navigation Components.
